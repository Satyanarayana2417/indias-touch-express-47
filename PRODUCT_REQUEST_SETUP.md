## File Structure

```

```

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env.local` to version control
2. **Firestore Rules**: Update Firestore security rules for production:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /product_requests/{document} {
         allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
         allow read, update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Authentication**: The current implementation uses email/password. Consider adding additional providers if needed.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Create an admin interface to view and manage product requests
2. **Email Notifications**: Set up automated email notifications for new requests
3. **Request Status Tracking**: Allow users to track the status of their requests
4. **File Upload**: Add support for product images or reference files
5. **Pricing Integration**: Add automated pricing calculations
6. **Request History**: Show users their previous requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase Connection Errors**: Verify your `.env.local` file has correct values
2. **Authentication Errors**: Check if Email/Password provider is enabled in Firebase
3. **Firestore Permission Errors**: Ensure Firestore is in test mode during development
4. **Build Errors**: Restart the development server after adding environment variables

### Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase configuration
3. Ensure all required environment variables are set
4. Check that Firebase services are properly enabled
