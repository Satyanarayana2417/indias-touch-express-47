# Product Detail Page - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Issue: Product Detail Page Not Visible

### ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

The issue was that the development environment had no sample products to display. I've fixed this by:

1. **Added automatic sample product creation** in `src/lib/products.ts`
2. **Created 5 sample products** with full data including variants, images, and descriptions
3. **Products are now auto-generated** when the app starts in development mode

### 🧪 **Test the Product Detail Page**

1. **Open the application**: `http://localhost:8081`
2. **Sample product URLs** (click or navigate to these):
   - `http://localhost:8081/product/sample-1` - Premium Turmeric Powder
   - `http://localhost:8081/product/sample-2` - Organic Garam Masala  
   - `http://localhost:8081/product/sample-3` - Traditional Brass Diya Set
   - `http://localhost:8081/product/sample-4` - Basmati Rice Premium
   - `http://localhost:8081/product/sample-5` - Handwoven Cotton Saree

### 🎯 **Features to Test on Product Detail Page**

1. **Image Gallery**:
   - ✅ Hover over main image for zoom effect
   - ✅ Click thumbnails to change main image

2. **Variant Selection**:
   - ✅ Select different weights/sizes (250g, 500g, 1kg)

   - Or open Developer Tools (F12) → Application → Storage → Clear All

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any error messages

3. **Verify Development Server**:
   - Make sure server is running: `npm run dev`
   - Check terminal for any error messages
   - Verify URL: `http://localhost:8081`
